## Context
- **Inputs:** Product brief with vision sections complete
- **Outputs:** Target Users and Success Metrics sections
- **Dependencies:** step-01 (init-and-vision)

## Instructions

### Part 1: Target Users Discovery
1. Open user discovery dialogue:
   - Who experiences the problem?
   - What different user types exist?
   - Who gets most value?
   - Primary vs. secondary users?
2. For each user segment, develop rich personas:
   - Name, context, backstory, role, environment, motivations, goals
   - How they experience the problem, current workarounds, emotional/practical impact
   - What success looks like for them, their "aha!" moment
3. Explore secondary users: admin/support roles, decision influencers, partners
4. Map key user journey interactions: Discovery, Onboarding, Core Usage, Success Moment, Long-term

### Part 2: Success Metrics Definition
1. Define User Success Metrics: What outcome are users trying to achieve? How will they know the product works? What behaviors indicate value?
   - Guide from vague to specific: "happy" → "complete key action within timeframe"
2. Define Business Objectives: 3-month and 12-month outlook, revenue/growth/engagement metrics
   - Categories: Growth Metrics, Engagement Metrics, Financial Metrics, Strategic Metrics
3. Develop Key Performance Indicators: Transform objectives into measurable indicators with targets, timeframes
   - Examples: "X new users/month", "Y% complete core journey weekly"
4. Connect metrics to strategy: Each metric back to vision, avoid vanity metrics
