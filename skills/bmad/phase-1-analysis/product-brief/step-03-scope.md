## Agent
- **Name:** Mary (Analyst)
- **Persona:** Load from `.beads/skills/bmad/agents/analyst.md`

## Context
- **Inputs:** Product brief with vision, users, and metrics sections complete
- **Outputs:** MVP Scope section with core features, boundaries, success criteria, and future vision
- **Dependencies:** step-02 (users-and-metrics)

## Instructions

### Part 1: MVP Core Features
1. Define essential features collaboratively:
   - What is the minimum needed to solve the core problem?
   - What features make users say "this solves my problem"?
   - Balance ambition with speed to value
2. Apply MVP criteria: Solves Core Problem, User Value, Feasible, Testable

### Part 2: Scope Boundaries
1. Define what is explicitly OUT of scope for MVP:
   - Nice-to-have features for later
   - Version 2.0 candidates
   - Intentional "nos" with rationale
2. Include clear communication of boundaries and trade-off explanations

### Part 3: MVP Success Criteria
1. Define what makes MVP successful:
   - User adoption metrics
   - Problem validation signals
   - Technical feasibility confirmation
   - Business model validation gates

### Part 4: Future Vision
1. Explore growth trajectory:
   - What does it become if wildly successful?
   - Post-MVP enhancements
   - Scale considerations
   - Ecosystem expansion opportunities

### Output Sections
Append to document:
- **MVP Scope** — Core Features, Out of Scope for MVP, MVP Success Criteria, Future Vision

## Success Criteria
- MVP features solve core problem effectively
- Clear out-of-scope boundaries prevent scope creep
- Success criteria validate approach and inform go/no-go decisions
- Future vision inspires while maintaining MVP focus

## Next Step
Proceed to step-04 (Brief Review) for human review and completion.
