# Step: UX Design Foundation and Visual Direction

## Agent
- **Name:** Sally (UX Designer)
- **Persona:** Load from `.beads/skills/meld/agents/ux-designer.md`

## Context
- **Inputs:** PRD (required), product brief, research documents
- **Outputs:** UX Design Specification with foundation, experience definition, visual direction, and user flows
- **Dependencies:** PRD must exist

## Instructions

### Part 1: Initialization and Discovery (MELD Steps 1-2)
1. Discover and load context documents (PRD required, brief recommended)
2. Create UX Design Specification from template at `{{planning_artifacts}}/ux-design-specification.md`
3. Fill context gaps: What are you building? Who is this for? What's special? Core user action?
4. Explore user context: problem, frustrations, tech-savviness, devices

### Part 2: Core Experience Definition (MELD Steps 3-5)
1. Define the ONE core user action (what users do most)
2. Explore platform requirements (web, mobile, desktop)
3. Identify effortless interactions and critical success moments
4. Synthesize 4 experience principles
5. Map desired emotional journey: discovery → core action → completion → recovery → return
6. Analyze 3-5 reference apps for transferable UX patterns
7. Create Design Inspiration Strategy: adopt, adapt, avoid

### Part 3: Design System and Visual Foundation (MELD Steps 6-8)
1. Present design system approaches:
   - Custom (full uniqueness, high investment)
   - Established (Material, Ant Design — fast, less unique)
   - Themeable (MUI, Chakra, Tailwind UI — balanced)
2. Recommend based on timeline, brand, team, maintenance needs
3. Define core interaction mechanics: initiation, interaction, feedback, completion
4. Establish visual foundation:
   - Color system (semantic mapping, accessibility)
   - Typography (type scale, hierarchy, pairing)
   - Spacing and layout (unit, grid, density)

### Part 4: Design Directions and User Flows (MELD Steps 9-10)
1. Generate 6-8 design direction variations exploring layout, interaction, color, density
2. Create comparison framework for evaluation
3. Map critical user journey flows from PRD:
   - Entry points, information at each step, decisions
   - Success/failure paths, error recovery
   - Progress indicators
4. Optimize for efficiency and delight

### Output Sections
- **Executive Summary** — Vision, users, challenges, opportunities
- **Experience Principles** — 4 core principles
- **Emotional Journey Map** — Phase-by-phase emotional goals
- **Design Inspiration** — References with adopt/adapt/avoid analysis
- **Design System Choice** — Selection with rationale
- **Visual Foundation** — Color, typography, spacing
- **Design Directions** — Variations with evaluation
- **User Journey Flows** — Flow diagrams for critical journeys

## Success Criteria
- Experience principles grounded in user needs
- Visual foundation supports product personality
- Design directions provide concrete comparison options
- User flows cover all critical journeys with success and failure paths

## Next Step
Proceed to step-02 (Components and Completion) for component strategy and finalization.
